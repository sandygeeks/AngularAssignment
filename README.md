# How to run Http Request Handling and Counter Function

## Http Request Handling
- Go to Http Request Handling Folder
- Initiate a command line on the folder
- Run ```npm install```
- After completion, run ```npx tsc```
- This will create an index.js in the Http Request Handling Folder.
- Run ```node index.js``` in the Http Request Handling Folder.

#### Note
The fetch method will not run on node with version less than 18.
This is an experimental feature and I wont intend to use it in production.

## Counter Function
- Go to Counter Function Folder
- Initiate a command line on the folder
- Run ```npm install```
- After completion, run ```npx tsc```
- This will create an index.js in the Counter Function Folder.
- Run ```node index.js``` in the Counter Function Folder.
